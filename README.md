# Using Age, Gender, and Happiness to Predict Income Level

## Abstract

Conducted by *Statistics Canada* every five years, the *General Social Survey* gathers socio-economic characteristics of Canadians across the board to monitor and improve their living conditions and well- being. With the help of this expansive data collection, the following paper utilizes regression analysis to determine the relationship between the intervieweesâ€™ score of feelings towards life with their level of income. It further investigates the impact of other variables such as age and gender to analyse their effect on the aforementioned relationship.Taking a quantitative approach to answer a highly qualitative query, this research will capitalize on economic disparity to provide a fresh lens from which one can view the modern society.
